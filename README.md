## ðŸŽ¨ Where to find everything?

This template is made by using several technologies.  
Below are explanations about where to find specific code.

Public resources are found in the folder `public`.

Data is stored in your admin console.

### Root HTML

There are two important HTML files in this project which are the root pages around the application. It is a bit different from a default React project as you in this case have two. One in root folder and one in `public`. The reason for this is that one is rendered before the other.

### CSS and images

The CSS in this project is of type Sass which is a CSS framework. You can read more using the link provided in Knowledge requirements. You can find the sass files together with the components in `client/src/components/` and there is one main sass file located on the top level `client/src/index.scss`. 


### Application

You can find the core frontend React application in `client/src`. Here you have a normal React setup with `index.jsx` as the glue that pieces the `.jsx` components together with the HTML. You will have to know React to use this template.


**Do not change the `w3s-dynamic-storage` folder name!**  
**By changing the `w3s-dynamic-storage` folder name, you risk the space not working properly.**
